  * chore: align 01-main README with current support
  * fix: deprecate cawbird as the OBS is empty and the github is archived
  * feat: add Ente Desktop
  * feat: add Angry Ip Scanner - ipscan
  * fix(openrgb): account for new naming and download from codeberg.
    They have changed both the base url for downloads and the naming scheme for release candidates
    They also have a hybrid version string in the actual package which needs mangling
  * Apply suggestions from code review
  * fix(gotop): deprecate gotop.
    No recent releases on github and the developer
    decamped to SourceHut. The last release on github installs with
    a weird version but whilst it could be kludged it seems better to
    just deprecate (until a new up-to-date source of deb is found).
    -------
    ```shell
    gotop
      Package:	gotop
      Repository:	01-main
      Updater:	deb-get
      Installed:	0.0.0~4.2.0+git
      Published:	4.2.0
    ```
    So if you install it you get updates forever without a fixup.
  * fix(readest): catch changed naming scheme
    includes updated support per #1554
  * fix(shutter-encoder): force grep to treat the cached html as text
    use `grep -a` so that output is not surpressed

  * fix(tixati): adapt to changed website structure
  * fix(tribler): re-do fix that was accidentally reverted
  * fix(smartgit): They have changed packaging slightly.
    Introduced seperate ARCH builds and also
    this aligns the version with what is present in the deb
    so users do not get spurious updates"
  * fix(vuescan): remove unneeded concatenation with missing quote.
    The hard coding is not needed and a lost/omitted quote breaks the definition.
    Best option is to remove both current and possible future problems.
  * feat: add slomore
  * fix(hugo): latest release has no packages for reasons.
    This removes the latest constraint as they have tagged a source-only version.
    Now that we trim our cache it may be better to take the cautious approach
    and stop getting latest tags altogether.
